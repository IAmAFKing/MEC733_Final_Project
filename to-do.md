- [x] turn speed to forward speed ratio for turns following line
    - the sharper the turn, the slower the car needs to be or the sharper the turn needs to be
    - if the turn is too sharp, will it veer off course?
    - what is the fastest forward speed
- [x] End line condition
    - Weird bug with it turning when it reaches the end
- [x] Push to main
- [x] Servo code
- [x] Ultra sonic
- [ ] Set up maze
- [x] Orientation
- [ ] Tune turning adjustments
- [ ] Maze solving algorithm skeleton
- [ ] Sudo and skeleton code for distance between maze cells

IN LAB:
- [ ] Tune turning adjustments for line tracking
- [ ] Determine how each tasks starts
    - If line tracking starts on horizontal black line, some code needs to be changed
    - Distance from end of line tracking to first maze cell
        - Can touch between tasks?
- [ ] Tune center bounds
- [ ] Start maze movements
    - [ ] Get approximate cell distance in time delay
    - [ ] 90 degree rotation in time delay
