- [x] turn speed to forward speed ratio for turns following line
    - the sharper the turn, the slower the car needs to be or the sharper the turn needs to be
    - if the turn is too sharp, will it veer off course?
    - what is the fastest forward speed
- [x] End line condition
    - Weird bug with it turning when it reaches the end
- [x] Push to main
- [x] Servo code
- [x] Ultra sonic
- [x] Set up maze
- [x] Orientation
    - Center range affects the angle the car can approach from before going backwards
    - Prefer if it is as tight as possible, testing needed from maze and what angles the car would reasonably approach from
- [x] Tune turning adjustments
- [x] Sudo and skeleton code for distance between maze cells
    - Figure out internal timers
- [x] Maze solving algorithm skeleton
- [ ] Transition between line tracking and maze
- [ ] Actual algorithm and solution

IN LAB:
- [x] Tune turning adjustments for line tracking
- [x] Determine how each tasks starts
    - If line tracking starts on horizontal black line, some code needs to be changed
    - Distance from end of line tracking to first maze cell
        - Can touch between tasks?
    - No starting black line
    - Can follow black line after finishing to get to start of maze
- [x] Tune center bounds
- [x] Start maze movements
    - [x] Get approximate cell distance in time delay
    - [x] 90 degree rotation in time delay
- [x] Figure out internal timers
- [ ] acrylic range from 600-750
